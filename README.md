Multi-objective learner performance-based behavior algorithm:In this work, a new multi-objective optimization algorithm called multi-objective learner performance-based behavior algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on the process of moving graduated students from high school to college. The proposed technique produces a set of non-dominated solutions. To test the ability and efficacy of the proposed multi-objective algorithm, it is applied to a group of benchmarks and five real-world engineering optimization problems. Several widely used metrics are employed in the quantitative statistical comparisons.
